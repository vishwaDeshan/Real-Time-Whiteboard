This project is aimed at building a real-time sharing whiteboard. It is developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) along with Socket.IO, which enables real-time communication between multiple users.

The whiteboard allows multiple users to collaborate on a shared canvas, in real-time. Users can draw and add different types of media to the canvas, which is then immediately visible to all other participants. This project is ideal for scenarios where multiple users need to work together on a visual project, such as brainstorming sessions or remote team meetings.

To use the whiteboard, users must have the MERN stack installed and running on their system. Once the project is cloned and dependencies are installed, users can start the server and access the whiteboard in their browser. The instructions for doing so are included in the project's documentation.
