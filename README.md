This project is aimed at building a real-time sharing whiteboard. It is developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) along with Socket.IO, which enables real-time communication between multiple users.

The whiteboard allows multiple users to collaborate on a shared canvas, in real-time. Users can draw and add different types of media to the canvas, which is then immediately visible to all other participants.
